# AFE Training | ReactJS | ToDo App
#### 1. Goal
- The goal of this project is to create a ToDo App that users can incorporate into their lives as a smart daily planner that can help them focus on their daily commitments and important tasks.

#### 2. Prerequisites
- This course assumes a basic knowledge of ReactJS.
- You will need the following tool [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html "create-react-app") installed.
- Use the tasks management tool (like Trello / Asana).
- Work with Scrum methodology.

#### 3. The technique we should use
- [React hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html "React hook"), [Redux fundamental](https://redux.js.org/ "Redux fundamental"), [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage "LocalStorage").
- [React router](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/tutorial "React router"), [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview "Formik") (Optional)
- Make UI responsive and more beauty with [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce "Ant Design"), [Styled Component](https://styled-components.com/ "Styled Component").
- Automation Testing With [Jest](https://jestjs.io/ "Jest") / [React Tesing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/ "React Tesing Library") (recommended) Or [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/ "Enzyme").
- Deploy Application of ReactJS (CLI) with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/ "Vercel") or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "Netlify").

#### 4. Application functionality
1. Authentication (login before using) - save user information to **localStorage**.
2. Create the task / Update the task (id / name / priority / description / due-date).
3. Display list of task / Remove the task.
4. Re-order the list of task (by priority or due-date).
5. Make the task as completed (individually or all tasks).
6. Store the daily list of tasks.

#### 5. We judge your codes by
- Easy to read and understand.
- Well organized and consistent.
- Test cases.
- How do you approach new technologies?

#### 6. More.
- You can use localStorage instead of calling remote APIs.
- Please build your TODO LIST APP with your creative mind (react-dnd like Trello if any).
#### 7. Link Asana
